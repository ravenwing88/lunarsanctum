            <h2>Resurrection</h2>
            <p>I'm back. It's been like a decade and a half, but I'm back.</p>
            <p>I can't even quantify, precisely, why I'm returning. Especially after all this time. It's not like anyone plays BoA anymore, even in the SW community. Gotta be some unsettled score or something.</p>
            <p>Nah, I've really been enjoying the minor projects I've taken on. And anyone who's likely to read this is equally likely to cringe at what some of those projects are.</p>
            <p>Eh, might as well just out with it. I've been patching up the old scenarios, to get myself back into the swing of things. For example, I recalled a few minor issues and suggestions about ItSoD that were generally easy to fix. Although a stronger compulsion for an update was based on the absolutely cringeworthy names I had for some of the characters and creature types; like, who the hell names a dragon "Gavin" anyway?</p>
            <p>And don't get me started on TRoR. Nothing quite like coming back 14 years later with a patch no one asked for, on a scenario that was pretty universally hated by an already scant audience. Especially when what I think was the primary grievance (the absolute hatred of the cameos) will never be fixed. Sorry. Just not worth it. Nobody's gonna play it anyway, so it hardly matters. This is for my own damn posterity, so you lot can pound sand. With love.</p>
            <p>Anyway. I do plan to pick up the threads of old scenario ideas. Although if you thought I was dawdling before, you're likely to be more disappointed now. Just not a priority. But I also think I'm far better at coding, storytelling, graphic design, and generally understanding how normal human beings interact, than I was as a teenager. So when you do see some output, the quality ought to be better by a wide margin.</p>
            <p>That's all I've got for now. I'll start uploading soon, once the new website's fully operational.</p>
